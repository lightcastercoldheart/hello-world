SUPER SECRET BANANA
----

What is Super Secret Banana?
 - it is a project I initiated during my senior year
 - it started as a publication about some of my favorite video games and their walkthroughs
 - it is my attempt at pondering how it has affected my life choices]
 - i do not intend to continue making it this way
 - i want it to be something i enjoy doing
 - it can be anything, really
 - right now I want it to be fun and relatable
 - it is my way of sharing how i see the world
 - i want it to be useful in some way
 - i want it to act as a portal to provide something that can make the world a better place
 - right now, (02/05/2015) it is not like that at all..
 - it will host most of my design experiments
 - maybe, a blog...
 - it might help me become more disciplined and responsible
 - i hope it does make me more disciplined and responsible
 - i want it to archive my design progress
 - i want to be better at everything
 - yeahh
